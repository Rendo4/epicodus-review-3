## Description

_Hello and thank you for viewing my Magic of looping application! This project uses concepts learned in my early weeks at epicodus. It combines HTML elements with bootstrap as well as a custom style sheet! The application will take a postitive number and create a list from 0 to the inputted number and replace numbers containing a 1, 2, or 3 with a custom message._

| Input      | Output     | 
| :---       |    :----:  |      
| 3          | Beep, Boop, Won't you be my Neighbor?     | 
| 5          | Beep, Boop, Won't you be my Neighbor?, 4, 5       |
